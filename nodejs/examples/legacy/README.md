These are the original examples that were in the examples folder. They're kept here for reference but the new organized structure in the parent directory is recommended for new users.

## Legacy Files

- `test-reports.js` - Original test suite
- `simple-report.js` - Original simple examples

- `cleanup-demo.js` - File cleanup examples
- `test_eywa_client.js` - Client testing
- `webdriver.js` - Browser automation example
- `hanging.js` - Debugging example

## Migration Notice

If you're using any of these files, consider migrating to the new organized structure:

- Reports: Use `../reports/`
- Files: Use `../files/`
- GraphQL: Use `../graphql/`
- Basic examples: Use `../quickstart/`
